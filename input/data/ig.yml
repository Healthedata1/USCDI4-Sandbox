    description: The US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile is based upon the
      core FHIR Condition Resource and meets the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability
      (USCDI) *Encounter Diagnosis* requirements. In version 5.0.0, The US Core Condition
      Profile has been split into the US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile
      and US Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile. To promote interoperability
      and adoption through common implementation, this profile defines constraints
      and extensions on the Condition resource for the minimal set of data to record,
      search, and fetch information about an encounter diagnosis.  It identifies which
      core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present
      in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when using this
      profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.

    description: "The US Core Laboratory Result Observation Profile is based upon\
      \ the US Core Observation Clinical Result Profile and, along with the US Core\
      \ DiagnosticReport Profile for Laboratory Results Reporting, meets the U.S.\
      \ Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Laboratory requirements. Laboratory\
      \ results are grouped and summarized using the DiagnosticReport resource, which\
      \ references Observation resources. Each Observation resource represents an\
      \ individual laboratory test and result value, a \u201Cnested\u201D panel (such\
      \ as a microbial susceptibility panel) that references other observations, or\
      \ rarely a laboratory test with component result values. The US Core Laboratory\
      \ Result Observation Profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource\
      \ to record, search, and fetch laboratory test results associated with a patient\
      \ to promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation. It\
      \ identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets SHALL\
      \ be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when\
      \ using this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific\
