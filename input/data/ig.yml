    description: The US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile is based upon the
      core FHIR Condition Resource and meets the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability
      (USCDI) *Encounter Diagnosis* requirements. In version 5.0.0, The US Core Condition
      Profile has been split into the US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile
      and US Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile. To promote interoperability
      and adoption through common implementation, this profile defines constraints
      and extensions on the Condition resource for the minimal set of data to record,
      search, and fetch information about an encounter diagnosis.  It identifies which
      core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present
      in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when using this
      profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.

      (USCDI) v3 'Patient Demographics' requirements. This profile sets minimum expectations
      for the Patient resource to record, search, and fetch basic demographics and
      other administrative information about an individual patient. It identifies
      which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present
      in the resource when using this profile to promote interoperability and adoption
      through common implementation.  It identifies which core elements, extensions,

    description: This Section describes the expected capabilities of the US Core Server
      actor which is responsible for providing responses to the queries submitted
      by the US Core Requestors. The complete list of FHIR profiles, RESTful operations,
      and search parameters supported by US Core Servers are defined. Systems implementing
      this capability statement should meet the ONC 2015 Common Clinical Data Set
      (CCDS) access requirement for Patient Selection 170.315(g)(7) and Application
      Access - Data Category Request 170.315(g)(8) and the ONC [U.S. Core Data for
      Interoperability (USCDI) Version 4 July 2023](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/isa/files/2023-07/Final-USCDI-Version-4-July-2023-Final.pdf).  US
      Core Clients have the option of choosing from this list to access necessary
      data based on their local use cases and other contextual requirements.
