description: To promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation,
  this profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search,
  and fetch average diastolic and systolic blood pressure observations with standard
  LOINC codes and UCUM units of measure. It is based on the US Core Vital Signs Profile
  and identifies which *additional* core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value
  sets  **SHALL** be present and constrains the way the elements are used when using
  the profile.  It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.

      The code (96607-7 Blood pressure panel mean systolic and mean diastolic)
      is added as a translation to the US Core vital Blood Pressure code
      (85354-9 Blood Blood pressure panel with all children optional).
