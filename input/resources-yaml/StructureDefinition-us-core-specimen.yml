description: This profile sets minimum expectations for the Specimen resource to record,
  search, and fetch "substances being sampled or tested. (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab,
  whole blood, serum, urine, wound swab)" associated with a patient to promote interoperability
  and adoption through common implementation.  It identifies which core elements,
  extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when
  using this profile.  It provides the floor for standards development for specific
  use cases.

Examples include but are not limited to hemolyzed, clotted, container leaking, and missing patient name. This may include information about the contents of the container, the container, and the label.
