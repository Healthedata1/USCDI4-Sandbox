**Profile Specific Implementation Guidance:**

- Treatment intervention preferences are patient-authored information used to share an individual's medical treatment and intervention goals, preferences, and priorities. They guide caregivers and medical personnel when the patient cannot communicate. The value for these types of observations is typically a string.
{% include additional-codings.md example1=', for example, the more specific LOINC, “75779-9 (Thoughts on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) [Reported])”'%}
- The observation **MAY** be derived from or reference a form or document (for example an advance directive document.) using `Observation.derivedFrom'.
