description: >-
  This profile sets minimum expectations for the Location resource for
  recording, searching, and fetching a "physical place of available services or
  resources."  It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and
  value sets **SHALL** be present and constrains how the elements are used when
  using the profile.  It provides the floor for standards development for
  specific use cases to promote interoperability and adoption through common
  implementation.
